# Directory for your requests

This folder contains files responsible for handling different types of server requests. For example, `getPosts.ts` handles requests for retrieving user data, while `postPosts.ts` is used for creating new users.

## Naming Convention

Each file name should start with the HTTP method (such as get, post, put, delete), followed by the endpoint name. For example:

- `getPosts.ts` — for getting user data
- `postPosts.ts` — for creating a new user

This approach helps to structure the code and makes it more understandable for developers.
